            Let's start from scratch. 

            First, Go ahead and install jQuery using a CDN (Google it, I'll wait...)
            
            Now, confirm it worked by typing $ in the chrome console 

            Let's just get comfortable with jQuery first...
            You can execute the following commands in the chrome console, OR here in index.html
            1. Select the "#main" container and set a border of "1px solid grey" (HINT: .css + object)
            2. Now APPEND a Fourth paragraph to "#main" with text "Fourth" (HINT: use an HTML string)
            3. Keeping in mind that jQuery methods always return jQuery objects...
                Can you "chain" all of the above into a single line? 
        */
$("#main").css({"border": "1px solid gray"}).append("<p>Fourth</p>");
//$("#main").css({"background-color": "gray"});
        /*
            Now, let's notice something interesting about jQuery
            1. Select all "p" elements with jQuery, and set a color "red" (same way as above)
                - Notice how you just set the "style" attribute on 4 elements at the same time
            2. Using this same jQuery "p" object, append a <span> that contains "item" (HINT: appendTo)
                - Notice what happened again!
            3. Finally, we want to set the color to "orange" JUST on the second paragraph
                - What happens if you try "direct indexing" (ex [1]), combined with the .css() method?
                - What if you try .first().next().css() ?
                - And finally [1].style.color = "blue" ?
        */
$("p").css("color", "red").append("<span>item</span>");
$("p").first().next().css("color", "blue");
        /*
            Next up, can you REFACTOR the following event listener into jQuery?

            Try both...
                1. setting this event listener on $('p')
                2. and setting it on on $('p').first()
            ...and note the difference
        document.querySelector('p').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
            console.log('clicked ', e.currentTarget.textContent)
        })
        */

      $('p').on('click', function(e) {
            console.log('clicked ', e.currentTarget.textContent)
      })

        /*
            Final challenge...
            Can you do all the following in a single line with JQUERY chaining?
            (Google anything you don't know how to do!)

            1. Create a new <button>
            2. Set its (text) color as "white", background color as "red"
            3. Set its text content as "Hide Text"
            4. Set a click event listener on this button, which...
                - Selects all "p" and "hides" them
                (HINT: use .hide() -- a jQuery method that sets display: none)
            5. now, append this new "button" to #main 

            You did it in one line, right? :)
        */
       $(`<button>Hide Text</button>`).css({"color": "white", "background-color": "red"}).on("click", function() { $("p").hide()}).appendTo("#main");
